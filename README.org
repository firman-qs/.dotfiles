* WHAT IS THIS?
This repo contains my personal configurations for several programs and linux rice (window manager, editor config, themes, fonts, etc.). You can use it by cloning and placing it in the appropriate directory. You can also use software such as [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] to make managing dotfiles on your device easier. If you are using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]], simply clone this repo in your home directory (ie. in =~= or ~/home/username/~)
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/firman-qs/.dotfiles.git
#+end_src
then go to the ~/.dotfiles folder by running the command:
#+begin_src bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
#+end_src
and run stow inside the dotfiles folder by runing:
#+begin_src bash
stow .
#+end_src

* WINDOW MANAGER
I use [[https://i3wm.org/][i3]] window manager and [[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]] (mainly) on linux. My workflow in both window managers is quite similar, consisting of two important things. First thing, I usually use standard tile mode or more often just tab mode (with a tab patch in the dwm). Second thing, I use =alt+tab= to switch between the last two workspaces I visited. The rest is just standard as most people use window managers.
** [[https://github.com/firman-qs/dwm-fqs][DWM]]
I applied quite a lot of patches (I think) in [[https://github.com/firman-qs/dwm-fqs][dwm on these dotfiles]]. Ironically, some of them I don't really use haha ðŸ˜‚ ..., like scratchpads and some additional layouts brought by the [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/vanitygaps/dwm-cfacts-vanitygaps-6.4_combo.diff][dwm-cfacts-vanitygaps-6.4_combo patch]]. However, this might be useful for you. You can see the patches applied to my dwm configuration in the [[https://github.com/firman-qs/dwm-fqs/tree/a2c042b92be867dc8c50793601affdd9a917ced9/patches][.dotfiles/.config/suckless/dwm/patches]] folder.

+ [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/xrdb/][dwm-xrdb-6.4.diff]]
This dwm configuration applies the [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/xrdb/][xrdb patch]] so you can set the color scheme using [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal][pywal]] or from static .Xresources files as usual without needing to touch the source file, =config.def.h= (This also applies to dmenu and st in this doftiles). [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/][Statuscmd]] patch also applied, so supports *emoji* and *click* in statusbar to run some commands.
*** How to Install?
To install my dwm build, run this command inside the =~/.dotfiles/.config/suckless/dwm= directory:
#+begin_src bash
sudo make install
#+end_src
For keybindings and other configurations please read [[https://github.com/firman-qs/dwm-fqs/blob/a2c042b92be867dc8c50793601affdd9a917ced9/config.def.h][config.def.h]]. Because these dotfiles use keychord patches, please pay close attention to the writing format if you want to customize it.
** [[https://i3wm.org/][i3]]
[[https://i3wm.org/][i3]] is a pretty straightforward window manager with rich features, my favorite after dwm (because I prefer dynamic tyling over manual). You can install i3 with your Linux distribution's package manager.
/We also need to install i3status./
**** Debian/Ubuntu and his grandchildren
#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install i3 i3status
#+end_src
**** Fedora and his friends
#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install i3 i3status
#+end_src
**** Arch and his children
#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -S i3 i3status
#+end_src
or if using [[https://github.com/Jguer/yay][yay]]
#+begin_src bash
yay -S i3 i3status
#+end_src

After that, make sure you have moved the [[https://github.com/firman-qs/.dotfiles/tree/main/.config/i3][i3]] and [[https://github.com/firman-qs/.dotfiles/tree/main/.config/i3status][i3status]] in dotfiles to the appropriate place or use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] as in [[https://github.com/firman-qs/.dotfiles/?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-this][WHAT IS THIS?]].
