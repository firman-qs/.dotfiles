* GETTING STARTED
This repo contains my personal configurations for several programs and linux rice (window manager, editor config, themes, fonts, etc.). You can use it by cloning and placing it in the appropriate directory. You can also use software such as [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] to make managing dotfiles on your device easier. If you are using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]], simply clone this repo in your home directory (ie. in =~= or ~/home/username/~)
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/firman-qs/.dotfiles.git
#+end_src
then go to the ~/.dotfiles folder by running the command:
#+begin_src bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
#+end_src
and run stow inside the dotfiles folder by runing:
#+begin_src bash
stow .
#+end_src

* CODE EDITOR
** GNU Emacs
My main code editor, specifically I use [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][doom emacs]]. I turned on literate config so I could use =config.org=
You can see my doom emacs configuration here:
- [[https://github.com/firman-qs/.dotfiles/blob/main/.config/doom/config.org][config.org]]
- [[https://github.com/firman-qs/.dotfiles/blob/main/.config/doom/init.el][init.el]]
- [[https://github.com/firman-qs/.dotfiles/blob/main/.config/doom/packages.el][package.el]]
#+begin_quote
An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor — and more. At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing.

** Neovim
My Neovim configuration uses lazy and is integrated with LSP. Take a look here.
- [[https://github.com/firman-qs/.dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim][~/.config/nvim]]
#+begin_quote
Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_%28text_editor%29][Stevie]]). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very clever—but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.

** VSCode
I don't need to describe it, you definitely already know or at least heard a lot about [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][VSCode]], a very common editor. Take a look at the config here: [[https://github.com/firman-qs/.dotfiles/tree/main/.config/Code/User][~/.cofig/Code]]
